Case 1: Overriding both equals(Object) and hashCode() method
******************************************************************************
You must override hashCode() in every class that overrides equals(). Failure to do so will result in a 
violation of the general contract for Object.hashCode(), which will prevent your class from functioning 
properly in conjunction with all hash-based collections, including HashMap, HashSet, and Hashtable.
Here is the contract, from the java.lang.Object specialization:

1:-  Whenever it(hashcode) is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of a Java 
application, the hashCode method must consistently return the same integer, provided no information used 
in equals comparisons on the object is modified. This integer need not remain consistent from one execution
 of an application to another execution of the same application.
2:-  If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each 
of the two objects must produce the same integer result.
3:-  It is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the equals(java.lang.Object) method,
then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results.
However, the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may
improve the performance of hashtables.
   
Case 2 : Overriding only the equals(Object) method
***************************************************************************************************
Employee emp1 = new Employee(1, " Ankit", "Singh", 5000);
Employee emp2 = new Employee(1, "Ankit", "Singh", 5000);
If we only override equals(Object) method, when we call map.put(emp1,"Deepak"); it will hash to some bucket
location and when we call map.put(emp2,"Deepak"); it will hash to some other bucket location because of different 
hashcode value as hashCode() method has not been overridden.

Case 3: Overriding only hashCode() method
*******************************************************************************************************
When we call map.put(emp1,"Deepak"); it will generate hashcode value and stores it to the bucket location that is
specified with this address (hashcode value). And when we call map.put(emp2,"Deepak"); it generates same hashcode
value as previous entry since key objects are same and hashCode() method has been overridden. So it should
replace first with second as per rule. But it didn’t. Reason is, when it iterate through that bucket and 
seeks to find k such that k.equals(1) i.e. if searching key already exist. But it fails to find because
equals(Object ) method has not been overridden. It is violation of rule of hashing.
